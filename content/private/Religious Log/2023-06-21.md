I haven't been able to pray fajr for the last couple of days due to 2 major problems
1. Sleeping late
2. My addiction
I need to sleep early so that I can wake up early as well
And I also need to fully realize the fact that nurturing my addiction by completing my craving will not in any way get me closer to my goals, The time I have spent in making my collection then further more going on to using that collection repeatedly is nothing but sickeningly sad.
The realization only comes after the fact that I have already done the deed. And The idea repeats itself all over again
