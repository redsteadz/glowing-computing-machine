## Journey to Junior Developer
The idea of consistency is an essential thing in development for a software engineer, I need to build a habit of being able to write code daily and with efficiency. Becoming good at something requires interest to a level of habit.

Forming a Habit;
- Timed consistency
	- As long as you repeat the same thing over and over again on a daily basis at a specified time frame, A habit will develop
- Trigger
	- A habit must have a trigger so that the habit can be performed at will when the trigger is pulled
		- Launching an IDE
- Reward
	- A habit can be maintained, If an _achievement_ is done every time habit is kept consistent
		- Dopamine Rush!
## Reading the Docs
A developer must master the documentation for any language or application
This is an essential skill required for a developer
- Use Documentation more often
