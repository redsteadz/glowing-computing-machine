## Syntax
```js
function callback(){
// The SIDE EFFECT
	return() =>{
		// The Cleanup of the side effect
		cleanup()
	};
}
useEffect(callback[, dependencies])
```

- `callback`Â is a function that contains the side-effect logic.Â `callback`Â is executed right after the DOM update.
- `dependencies`Â is an optional array of dependencies.Â `useEffect()`Â executesÂ `callback`Â only if the dependencies have changed between renderings.

>>The **Effect** part basically gives an idea about what this is ! It basically creates a side-effect when a component is mounted; but that is not the limitation of this Hook. It is capable of running with condition like:
>>1. Whenever the component is mounted and unmounted
>>2. The dependency has a changed between re rendering

## Easy Explanation;
You know those potion effect in minecraft ? 
Well, usually they are independent of whatever or wherever the hell the player is ! 
the `callback` is the effect of those potions, and the action of throwing/drinking the potion is dependent on;
- Mounting/Unmounting the component (Regeneration potion for fighting, Regeneration potion after fighting)
- Dependencies (If health is low, then drink them potions)
- The `cleanup()` function can be thought of as drinking milk to remove all effects! (But that `cleanup()` can technically be anything)



A **side effect** is any action that is independent of the output
While props / states work on the output directly and the functionality of the component, `useEffect` releases a `callback` function which is can remain disconnected to the changes of component

A thing to not here is that there is another `cleanup()` return which is capable running when the component is unmounted !
