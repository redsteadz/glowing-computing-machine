React is based on UI by components
Components are basically "sections " or "divisions" of a website as illustrated below

Furthermore these components have two parts:
- State
	- It relates to the how the component is present, if something is interacting to it. What should be done if interacted with and so on
- Props
	- Deals with the information with the component, Paragraphs, names, prices.
