# Step To Solve a Program
- **Understand Given Problem**
- **Approach**
	- Could include flowcharts / algorithms
	- Dry runs using the algorithm
	- Breaking the problem into sub problems and finding solutions for those
		- Building the original problem from these solutions
- **Program**

## Flowchart Symbols

## Pseudocode
- Generic way of representing logic
```pseudocode

sum = a + b
print sum
```
