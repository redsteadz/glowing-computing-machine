### TASK # 1:
Write source code to display “My name is xyz. I am First semester student of Electrical
Engineering @ FAST-NU” at output screen?

```run-cpp
int main(){
	string name;
	//cin >> name;
	name = "JOSH";
	cout << "My name is " << name << ". I am First semester student of Electrical Engineering @ FAST-NU";
	return 0;
}
```

### TASK # 2:
Write a program that generates the following table:
1990 135
1991 7290
1992 11300
1993 16200
Use a single cout statement for all output.

```run-cpp
int main(){
	string tab = "    ";
	cout << "1990" << tab << "135" << endl 
	<< "1991" << tab << "7290" << endl
	<< "1992" << tab << "11399" << endl
	<< "1993" << tab << "16200" << endl;
	return 0;
}
```


### TASK # 3:
Write a program to enter velocity, acceleration and time and print final velocity using the formula:
v = u + a * t.
```cpp
int main(){
	float u;
	float v;
	float a;
	float t;
	
	cout << "Enter init_velocity: ";
	cin >> u;
	
	cout << "Enter acceleration: ";
	cin >> a;
	
	cout << "Enter time: ";
	cin >> t;
	
	v = u + a*t;
	cout << "final velocity is: " << v << endl;
	return 0;
}
```

### TASK # 4:
Write a program to enter five integers and print their average at the output.

```cpp
int main(){
	float num; // Can use int 
	float sum = 0; // but averages are not always whole numbers
	for (int i =1; i <=5; i++){
		cout << "Input integer #" << i;
		cin << num;
		sum = sum + num;
	}
	cout << "Avg is " << (sum/5);
	return 0;
}
```


### TASK # 5:
Write a program to generate Salary Slip for at least five (5) employees one by one. The output will present in a different screen.
On First screen, the following information will be taken by user for each of 5 employees.
- Employee’s Name
- Employment code no.
- Designation
- Basic Salary
The Second screen will only use to display/show the data entered by user on first screen. (First
screen will only use for data entering/input values) 

Example of using `cls` or `clear`
They basically clear the screen of the terminal

```run-cpp
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(){
    string name;
    cout << "ENTER NAME: ";
    cin >> name;
	system("clear"); // For linux
	// system("cls"); // For Windows
	cout << "The name is " << name << endl;
	return 0;
}
```

for the task

```cpp
int main(){
	string name;
	int code;
	string designation;
	int salary;
	
	// Input screen
	cout << "Enter Name: ";
	cin >> name; 

	cout << "Enter code: ";
	cin >> code; 

	cout << "Enter designation: ";
	cin >> designation; 

	cout << "Enter salary: ";
	cin >> salary; 
	
	system("clear"); // This is for linux , use cls for windows systems

	// Output Screen
	cout << "{Data of - " << name << " - " << "#" << code << "}" << endl;
	cout << "Designation " << designation << endl;
	cout << "Base Salary $" << salary << endl;


	return 0;

}
```

#### Screen 2

- This code can be improved by using `getline` for designation
