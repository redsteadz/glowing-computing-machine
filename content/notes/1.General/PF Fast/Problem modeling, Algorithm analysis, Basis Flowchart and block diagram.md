## Six Steps of Problem Solving

1) Identify the problem 
2) Understand the problem
3) Identify alternative ways to solve the problem
4) Select the best way to solve the problem from the list of alternative solutions
5) List instructions that enable you to solve the problem from the list of alternative solutions
6) List instructions that enable you to solve the problem using the selected solution.
7) Evaluate the solution

Algorithmic solutions is are those which can be solved using a specific amount of steps and are not dependent on senses, experience, perception or opinions

## What problem can be solved by computer ?
 - When the solution can be produced by a set of step-by-step procedures or actions.
 - This step-by-step action is called an algorithm.
 - The algorithm will process some inputs and produced output.
 - Solving problem by computer undergo two phases:
	 - **Phase 1**:
		 - Organizing the problem or pre-programming phase.
	 - **Phase 2**:
		 - Programming phase.

# Pre Programming Phase
1) Analyzing the problem.
2) ~~**HIPO** Hierarchy Input Process-Output~~ or **PAC** Programming Analysis Chart (PAC)
3) Developing the Input-Process-Output (IPO) Chart.
4) Drawing Program flowcharts.
5) Writing Algorithms.

- Emphasis on Data?
**eg**

| Data                 | Processing                    | Output |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------ |
| Hours work, pay rate | Salary = Hours work * payrate | Salary | 


### **Input Process Output (IPO) Chart**
â€¢ Extends and organizes the information in the Problem
Analysis Chart.
â€¢ It shows in more detail what data items are input, what are the
processing or modules on that data, and what will be the result
or output.
â€¢ It extends information from PAC.
**eg**

| Input          | Processing            | Module | Output    |
| -------------- | --------------------- | ------ | --------- |
| - Hours Worked | - Enter Hourly Worked | 1100   | - Net pay |
| - PayRate      | - Enter Pay Rate      | 1200   |           |
| - Deductions   | - Calculate Gross Pay | 1000   |           |
|                | - Enter Deductions    | 2100   |           |
|                | - Calculate Net Pay   | 2000   |           |
|                | - Print cheque        | 3000   |           |
