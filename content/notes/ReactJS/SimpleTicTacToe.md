As a person who just becomes outright bored at watching tutorial videos, I thought It'd be best to make a simple TicTacToe game and change the styles and design as we go along from the documentation provided at [React docs](https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe). 

Immediately I was faced with an odd error that came out of nowhere while the reasoning being mysterious too!
```
./src/App.js
  Line 4:  'React' must be in scope when using JSX  react/react-in-jsx-scope
  Search for the keywords to learn more about each error.
```

Which was fixed by adding the line 
`import React from 'react';` At the start of **App.js**

The contents of App.js being:
```javascript
import React from 'react';

export default function Square() {
  return <button className="square">X</button>;
}
```

Here, This code is a _component_ or a 'part' of the bigger picture you can say, 
_"A component being a reusable piece of code that represents a part of a user interface"_
![](notes/ReactJS/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230703002714.png)

For example in this, The parts can be broken into components like this and can even be broken into sub-components! (Like NavBar has the Search engine)

- `export` Allows the function to be accessible outside of the file
- `default` says that this is the main function in the file

### index.js
This file is the connection of all your components to the overall web application that you have running 
```js
import React, { StrictMode } from "react";
import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";
import "./styles.css";

import App from "./App";
```
- Imports the necessary libraries, Component(App), Styles for the components


```js
const root = createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
root.render(
  <StrictMode>
    <App />
  </StrictMode>
);
```

This part imports the components in their appropriate positions/Sections and throws it out in the form of **_index.html_**

## App.js
Now one of the fundamental things to keep in mind for react is that React components need to return a **single** JSX element !
Solutions:
- add a `<div> MULTIPLE COMPONENTS </div>`
- **Recommended** `<React.Fragments>`
- add `<> MULTIPLE COMPONENTS </>` known as fragments.

;#**For some reason, the fragments are not working and giving an error, So DIV IT IS!**
IT TURNS OUT!! That `<></>` is not supported by all tools. So using `<React.Fragments>`

# Props 
Now that I have made a Board 3x3, I need to pass information when an event occurs (click)

So first I split the `square` into a different function
```js
function Square() {
  return <button className="square">1</button>;
}

export default function Board() {
  // ...
}
```
This function was recalled into the `Board()` function like so

```js
export default function Board() {
  return (
    <React.Fragment>
      <div className="board-row">
        <Square/>
        <Square/>
        <Square/>
      </div>
```

Giving **Props** to the function can be done by adding `{variable}` to the respective function 
```js
function Square({val}) {
  return <button className="square">{val}</button>;
}
```
Note that `{}` was added when that variable was recalled into the HTML, that is a distinguishing part of JSX! It can run javascript when curly brackets are added

Furthermore an event can now be easily called by adding a function `handleClick`
```js
function Square({val}){
  function handleClick(){
    console.log("clickity-clack!")
  }   
  return <button className='square' onClick={handleClick}> {val} </button>
}
```

Success!

It needs to remember though, currently already clicked things can be clicked again as well `useState` can be used 

`useState` is a hook in React that allows you to add state to functional components. It is a built-in function that returns an array containing a state variable and a function to update that variable.

The `useState` hook takes an initial value as parameter and returns an array with two elements. The first element is the current state value and the second element is a function to update the state value.

Here's an example of using `useState`:

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const increment = () => {
    setCount(count + 1);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this example, the `count` state variable is initially set to 0 using `useState(0)`. The `setCount` function is used to update the value of `count` when the button is clicked.

AS SUCH!
Our code becomes;
```js
import {useState} from 'react'

function Square(){
  const [val, setval] = useState(null);

  function handleClick(){
    setval("X");
  }
  
  return (
      <button className='square' onClick={handleClick}>
       {val} 
      </button>
  )
}

```

While this works to some extent, it has some issues 
1. The prop is passed by Square, And hence cannot be interacted with by the board 
2. As this is the case, 1 Single square component has no access to the state values of other squares
The fix to this is to add the state to the board component, while this works. Fixing the problems stated above
It limits the data flow to the Board alone, Meaning any component WITHIN board can access it but not before the board, So if we were to implement a system of previous moves. There wouldn't be an easy way to manage the state of the board 

So an EVEN better solution is to add another mega OMEGA component that deals with everything from the board, squares and what not. The component being ` Game `  this state will be able to manage the previous entries as well as give the control of the entire system to a single component 
Making the code less spaghetti overall

Did some shiet on here
but it's alright
