> [!question] 
> You are given a **0 indexed** integer array `nums` and an integer `p`. Find `p` pairs of indices of `nums` such that the **maximum** difference amongst all the pairs is **minimized**. Also, ensure no index appears more than once amongst the `p` pairs.
> Note that for a pair of elements at the index `i` and `j`, The difference of this pair is `|nums[i] - nums[j]|`, where `|x|` represents the **absolute value** of 'x'. 
> Return the **minimim maximum** difference among all `p` pairs. We define the maximum of an emprty set to be zero.
### Example 1:
**Input:** `nums = [10,1,2,7,1,3], p = 2`
**Output:** `1`
**Explanation:** The first pair is formed from the indices 1 and 4, and the second pair is formed from the indices 2 and 5. 
The maximum difference is `max(|nums[1] - nums[4]|, |nums[2] - nums[5]|) = max(0, 1) = 1`. Therefore, we return `1`.
### **Example 2:**
**Input:** `nums = [4,2,1,2], p = 1`
**Output:** `0`
**Explanation:** Let the indices 1 and 3 form a pair. The difference of that pair is `|2 - 2| = 0`, which is the minimum we can attain.

## Understanding:
This question is asking about finding the pairs of numbers (x, ,y) such that the difference between them is minimum. And should return the **maximum** value from the pairs
`nums = [3,4,2,3,2,1,2] and p = 3`
here the pairs can be 
2 - 2 = 0
3 - 3 = 0 
4 - 3 = 1
Maximum value of which is 1

## Process:
The best way to solve this (from what I can think of is) by picking a value from the array and finding the smallest difference it can make with another number, and popping it out. The remaining elements will go through the same thing and the resulting pair of differences will be arranged in ascending order which can be picked for pth value

```
nums = [10,1,2,7,1,3]
After sort
[ 1, 1, 2, 3, 7, 10 ]
MinDiff(nums[0]) = 0
MinDiff(nums[1]) = 1
MinDiff(nums[2]) = 3

Take these values into an array -> Sort in ascending -> arr[p-1]

nums = [4,2,1,2]
Aftert Sort
[ 1, 2, 2, 4 ]
MinDiff(nums[0]) = 1
MinDiff(nums[1]) = 0
MinDiff(nums[2]) = 1
```

```js
let nums = [10,1,2,7,1,3]
console.log(nums.sort((a,b)=>{return a-b}))
let nums2 = [4,2,1,2]
console.log(nums2.sort((a,b)=>{return a-b}))
```
