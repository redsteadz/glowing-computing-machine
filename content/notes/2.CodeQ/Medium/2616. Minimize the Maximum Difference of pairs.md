> [!question] 
> You are given a **0 indexed** integer array `nums` and an integer `p`. Find `p` pairs of indices of `nums` such that the **maximum** difference amongst all the pairs is **minimized**. Also, ensure no index appears more than once amongst the `p` pairs.
> Note that for a pair of elements at the index `i` and `j`, The difference of this pair is `|nums[i] - nums[j]|`, where `|x|` represents the **absolute value** of 'x'. 
> Return the **minimim maximum** difference among all `p` pairs. We define the maximum of an emprty set to be zero.
### Example 1:
**Input:** `nums = [10,1,2,7,1,3], p = 2`
**Output:** `1`
**Explanation:** The first pair is formed from the indices 1 and 4, and the second pair is formed from the indices 2 and 5. 
The maximum difference is `max(|nums[1] - nums[4]|, |nums[2] - nums[5]|) = max(0, 1) = 1`. Therefore, we return `1`.
### **Example 2:**
**Input:** `nums = [4,2,1,2], p = 1`
**Output:** `0`
**Explanation:** Let the indices 1 and 3 form a pair. The difference of that pair is `|2 - 2| = 0`, which is the minimum we can attain.

## Understanding:
This question is asking about finding the pairs of numbers (x, ,y) such that the difference between them is minimum. And should return the **maximum** value from the pairs
`nums = [3,4,2,3,2,1,2] and p = 3`
here the pairs can be 
2 - 2 = 0
3 - 3 = 0 
4 - 3 = 1
Maximum value of which is 1

## Process:
Let's first sort the array
- Sort(nums) -- Ascending order
After that we need two numbers from this let's call them nums\[i] and nums\[j] where these numbers must be the lowest Objective Function
But what is the objective function is ?

If the array is `nums = [1,1,2,3,7,10]`

What needs to be kept in mind is that
`max(pair1, pair2, pair3 . . .pairN)` has to have pair that will have least values !
The way finding that minimum maximum would be possible 
Let's assume the minimum to be `x`
After which we check if there are that many pairs or more with the same or less difference than x
- `nums = [a,b,c,d,e,f]`
- ` no_of_pairs_with_diff <= x ? `
	- If `no_of_pairs_with_diff >= p` Then we still haven't found the minimum

### Algorithm
- Sort nums in Ascending Order
	- Find floor mid difference of the array
- Make [[notes/1.General/Algorithms/binary_search|binary_search]]:
	- Left = 0, Right = nums\[first] - nums\[last]
	- Make Loop while Left < Right
		- If (no_Of_Pair with (diff <= mid) ) < p
			- left = mid + 1
		- else 
			- right = mid
	- return Left

### Code In JS
```js
var minimizeMax = function(nums, p) {
        nums.sort((a,b)=>{return a - b})
    let left = 0
    let right = nums[nums.length - 1] - nums [0]
    while (left < right){
        mid = Math.floor((left + right)/2)
        if (canPair(mid, nums) < p){
            left = mid  + 1
        } else {
            right = mid
        }
    }; return left
};

function canPair(mid, nums){
    let count = 0
    for (let i = 0; i <= nums.length - 1;){
            let diff = nums[i+1] - nums[i]
            if (diff <= mid){
                count++
                i += 2
            } else {
                i++
            }
    }
    return count
}
```
