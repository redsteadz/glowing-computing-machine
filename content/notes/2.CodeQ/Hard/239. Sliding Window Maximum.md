You are given an array of integers `nums`, there is a sliding window of size `k` which is moving from the very left of the array to the very right. You can only see the `k` numbers in the window. Each time the sliding window moves right by one position.

Return _the max sliding window_.

**Example 1:**
```
**Input:** nums = [1,3,-1,-3,5,3,6,7], k = 3
**Output:** [3,3,5,5,6,7]
**Explanation:** 
Window position                Max
---------------               -----
[1  3  -1] -3  5  3  6  7       **3**
 1 [3  -1  -3] 5  3  6  7       **3**
 1  3 [-1  -3  5] 3  6  7      ** 5**
 1  3  -1 [-3  5  3] 6  7       **5**
 1  3  -1  -3 [5  3  6] 7       **6**
 1  3  -1  -3  5 [3  6  7]      **7**
```

**Example 2:**
```
**Input:** nums = [1], k = 1
**Output:** [1]
```

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
- `-104 <= nums[i] <= 104`
- `1 <= k <= nums.length`

## Naive Approach
- Set: i=0, j=k
- Slice the array into i -> k 
	- sort in descending
	- push\[0] into the max array
- i++; j++

This shit is hella slow for larger arrays, So organizing for larger arrays is not really possilbe
### Time Complexity
The time complexity of the given function can be analyzed step by step:

1. Initializing variables `j`, `i`, and `max` takes constant time, O(1).

2. The while loop runs `nums.length - k + 1` times. This is because the loop starts from index `i = 0` and goes up to index `i = nums.length - k`, since you're considering subarrays of length `k`. So, the loop runs approximately `nums.length - k` times.

3. Inside the loop, you're using the `slice` method, which takes O(k) time, and then you're using the `sort` method, which takes O(k * log(k)) time (since you're sorting a subarray of length `k`).

4. Pushing an element into the `max` array is a constant time operation.

Overall, the time complexity of each iteration of the loop is O(k * log(k)) due to the sorting step.

Since the loop runs approximately `nums.length - k` times, and each iteration has a time complexity of O(k * log(k)), the total time complexity of the function can be approximated as follows:
Total time complexity ≈ (nums.length - k) * (O(k * log(k)))

Asymptotically, when `k` is smaller than `nums.length`, the O(k * log(k)) term dominates, so you can simplify the expression to:
Total time complexity ≈ O((nums.length - k) * k * log(k))

This can be further simplified to:
Total time complexity ≈ O(nums.length * k * log(k))

So, the time complexity of the provided function is approximately O(nums.length * k * log(k)) in the worst case.
